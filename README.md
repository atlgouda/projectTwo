# League of Your Imagination
## A basketball league filled with ANYONE!

## Inspiration
My friends and I often have a debate about which athletes would do well in other sports on a professional level.  Could Lebron be a soccer striker?  What if Tom Glavine his NHL contact over becoming a starting pitcher.  With this thought in mind I built a site in which users can create teams filled with whichever players they choose, and have them play games at any location.

## Overview
Once a user comes to the site, they will get to a landing page with a brief description of this website.  From there, they will enter into a league with some teams that have already been pre-seeded.  The league page will have some preloaded teams to start. Some of the site attributes include:
* Creating a new team, player, or game
* Editing an existing team, player or game
* Deleting a team, player or game
* Load images for team logos, locations of games, and players
* Create a basketball card for players
* Add a description to describe and new or existing team.
